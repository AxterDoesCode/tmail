To section should also be enforced when r is pressed to fetch the current email but if i want to just write a new email then that section should be empty?

This begs the question that I can't send an email if it doesn't exist, gonna need some checks to be performed for that one

Should try to get multiple emails sent like by using a comma separated value

Also need to get the fuckin html emails working that is gonna be a straight headache

Also look at adding a help/controls menu (overlapping view, create it focus it then delete it) so yeah turns out this isn't too hard

should look at content type of the email and figure it out from there (strings.contains)

Then need to start looking into writing an email and maybe even writing a custom text editor for it

change J and K commands to be relative to maxresults (On second thought maybe not)
